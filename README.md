# Optimal_Guidance_and_Control_problems

The following explores optimal trajectories to minimize the time for a boat to reach a particular point on the shore after a medical emergency, 
subject to currents. The ship is located at the point $(x_i,y_i) = (−20,0)$ ml at time t = 0, and has to reach the shore as soon as possible. It is 
known that there is a small city at the location $(x_f,y_f) = (−15,35.5)$ ml with a medical center. We want therefore to determine the fastest possible 
route to the city. It is assumed that the speed of the ship with respect to the water is constant, v = 15ml/hr. We also know the speed and direction 
of the sea currents in the area, which are given to you from a meteorological satellite as $\vec{v}_c = u(x,y)\textbf{i} +v(x,y)\textbf{j}$.
